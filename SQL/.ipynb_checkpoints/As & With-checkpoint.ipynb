    "### AS & WITH\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've learned how to use these clauses in our queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT ... \n",
    "    FROM ...\n",
    "    (WHERE) ...\n",
    "    GROUP BY ...\n",
    "    (HAVING) ...\n",
    "    ORDER BY\n",
    "\n",
    "By this point, our queries are getting pretty long, which can make them hard to puzzle out exactly what we're asking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also started using functions like EXTRACT() to get information out of dates or aggregate functions like COUNT(). You may have noticed, however, that the columns that we use these functions are are returned with names like _f0 and _f1, which aren't very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry, though, we're going to learn how to get around both of these problems. Today, we're going to learn how to use AS and WITH to tidy up our queries and make them easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AS\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's talk about the AS clause. AS lets you refer to the the columns generated by your queries with different names, which is also know as \"aliasing\". (If you use Python a lot you might already have used as for aliasing if you've ever done something like import pandas as pd or imports seaborn as sns.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use AS in SQL, you just insert it right after the name of the column you select. Here's an example of a query without an AS clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp), data_point_3\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's an example of the same query, but with AS.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM column_with_timestamp) AS day,\n",
    "            data_point_3 AS data\n",
    "    FROM `bigquery-public-data.imaginary_dataset.imaginary_table`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these queries will return the exact same table, but in the second query the columns returned will be called day and data, rather than the default names of _f0 and data_point_3.\n",
    "WITH... AS\n",
    "\n",
    "On its own, AS is a convenient way to make your code easier to read and tidy up the data returned by your query. It's even more powerful when combined with WITH in what's called a \"common table expression\" or CTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Common table expression: A temporary table that you return within your query. You can then write queries against the new table you've created. CTE's only exist inside the query where you create them, though, so you can't reference them in later queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "CTE's are very helpful for breaking up your queries into readable chunks and make it easier to follow what's going on in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how to use them. We're going to be the same small Pets table that we've been working with previously, but now it includes information on the ages of all the different animals. These are in a column called \"Years_old\":\n",
    "\n",
    "We might want to ask questions about older animals in particular. One way that we could do this is to create a CTE that only contains information about older animals and then write get information about it. So we can create a CTE which only contains information about animals more than five years old like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # note that this query won't return anything!\n",
    "    WITH Seniors AS \n",
    "            (\n",
    "                SELECT ID, Name\n",
    "                FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "                WHERE Years_old > 5\n",
    "            )\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create the following temporary table that we can then refer to in the rest of our query, which only has the ID and Name of the animals that are seniors:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted additional information about this table, we can write a query under it. So this query will create the CTE shown above, and then return all the ID's from it (in this case just 2 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "    WITH Seniors AS \n",
    "            (\n",
    "                SELECT ID, Name\n",
    "                FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n",
    "                WHERE Years_old > 5\n",
    "            )\n",
    "            \n",
    "    SELECT ID\n",
    "    FROM Seniors\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do this without a CTE, but if this were the first part of a very long query, removing the CTE would make it much harder to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: How many Bitcoin transactions are made per month?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's work through an example with a real dataset. Today, we're going to be working with a Bitcoin dataset (Bitcoin is a popular but volatile cryptocurrency). We're going to use a common table expression (CTE) to find out how many Bitcoin transactions were made per month for the entire timespan of this dataset.\n",
