    "### Avoiding Common Mistakes when Querying Big Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Big data is great! But working at a bigger scale makes your problems bigger too, like this professor whose experiment racked up an unexpected $1000 bill. Kaggle isn't charging for accessing BigQuery datasets, but these best practices can help you avoid trouble down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using the asterisk (*) in your queries. The asterisk means “everything”. This may be okay with smaller datasets, but getting everything from a 4 terabyte dataset takes a long time and eats into your monthly usage limit.\n",
    "- For initial exploration, look at just part of the table instead of the whole thing. If you're just curious to see what data's in a table, preview it instead of scanning the whole table. The BigQueryHelper.head() method in our helper package does this. Like head() in Pandas or R, it returns just the first few rows for you to look at.\n",
    "- Double-check the size of complex queries. If you're planning on running what might be a large query, either estimate the size first or run it using the BigQueryHelper.query_to_pandas_safe() method.\n",
    "- Be cautious about joining tables. In particular, avoid joining a table with itself (i.e. a self-join) and try to avoid joins that return a table that's larger than the ones you're joining together. (You can double-check yourself by joining just the heads of the tables.)\n",
    "- Don't rely on LIMIT: One of the things that can be confusing when working with BigQuery datasets is the difference between the data you scan and the data you actually get back especially since it's the first one that actually counts against your quota. When you do something like select a column with LIMIT = 10, you'll only get 10 results back, but you'll scan the whole column (and that counts against your monthly usage limit)."
